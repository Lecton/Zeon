Bugs:
	Video notification icon display. When remove from stream is called and window is closed afterwards. Should not display the icon
	Unselecting should dismount the active user from GUI control. Used by the displaying of the stream acceptors
	Avatar Picture resizing - will remove load time. Do not use original sized avatars. Do this client-side.
